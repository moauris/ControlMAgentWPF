# Control-M/Agent WPF
A CRUD WPF &amp; Entity Framework Application for BMC Control-M Agent Application Data management

## Introduction

During my last project I was responsible for manage client team's demand for installing, changing, and uninstalling BMC's Control-M/Agent product on their host machines.

We manage a couple of Control-M/Servers on our end, and our job is to guide them to install Control-M/Agent client on their VMs or physical machines, and manage the health and availability for their script running automation process.

There is a need to record and manage their requests, and we have been doing this via an excel spreadsheet.

Over the years there have been attempts to migrate to a database, and several other improvement of this task, but due to a prompt termination of the project, none attempts are implemented to the fullest.

For demo purposes, I want to revisit the idea and create a mock up application in WPF to manage the requests.
